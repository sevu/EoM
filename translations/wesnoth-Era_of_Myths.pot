"For centuries, there have been tales about mighty wind spirits known as djinns that are oft summonable with magical metallic objects of ethereal origin. In many stories, these objects are oil lamps. Most of the tales mention that if a djinn is summoned by these types of objects, the djinn is obliged to carry out the wishes of the summoner. Due to this fact, the abilities of djinns are often highly exaggerated, to the point of granting any wish of the summoner. In reality, these spirits are only capable of accomplishing feats within the limits of the power of the wind and swordsmanship.\n"
"\n"
"Despite the reality of these creaturesâ€™ abilities, many believe that djinns are virtually omnipotent beings, thus they speculate what force or god created the djinn and for what reason. Some even believe that a race of divine beings created the djinn in order to serve them. Although these theories could be true, djinns are often spawned by violent storms being exposed to incredibly powerful magic or created by immensely powerful wind mages."

"In an age long forgotten by the rest of the world, when the Windsong first took up their watch, they realized that it would be impractical to carry out their duty of balancing without becoming dangerously numerous themselves. The Windsong needed servants who could become numerous in times of balancing and quickly decrease in times of hiding. Servants who could be trusted utterly, could travel quickly and were able to perform a variety of tasks. The cipher, the only power used by the Windsong, was capable of carving such servants from The Raw and binding them into reality. But this required the full attention of an Ascendant to maintain even a handful of these Shards. And so the Windsong gathered the most powerful Cryptographers (those who use ciphers) to the Foundation, and had them construct an artifact of unimaginable, though very defined, power to do it for them. It took centuries to create, but with it the Windsong were finally complete.\n"

A successful binding will slowly, over the course of two years, pull her body into The Raw. If the Ascending fails, she faces a slow death.
