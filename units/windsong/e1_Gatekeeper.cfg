    description= _ "The Windsong Foundation, though hidden far in the arctic northern seas, still represents too great a target to be left unguarded. The Gatekeepers have kept their cousins safe throughout the Age of Patience, and they have no intention of ceasing their vigilance now.

Devoting themselves to the study of combat, they have created a unique, unarmed style which allows them to fight without removing their ceremonial blindfolds."
