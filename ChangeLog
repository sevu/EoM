---notes
1) With the removal of the Holy damage type from the Default era,
   the main reason for the existance of a Shadow damage type is
   gone.  With the addition of the Arcane damage type to mirror
   the Default era, the Holy and Shadow damage types are now
   unnecessary, and thus removed.
2) With the addition of the Arcane damage type, there is a non-physical
   damage type that is non-spiritual.  Psychic damage was originally
   created to approximate a damage type that was neither physical nor
   spiritualy weighted (good v evil) in some way, as Holy/Shadow were.
   Since Arcane has removed this spiritual element, Psychic damage is no
   longer a necessity.  I have left the resistancies in place on the
   chance that the damage type may once again be added at some point,
   whether through changing the entire era once again, or through simply
   adding another playable era to the Era of Myths add-on with customized
   units.
   Psychic damage would in the future be defined as the extent to which
   a unit would suffer psychic assaults.  Intelligent beings will thus
   resist Psychic damage whereas unitelligent beings will be susceptible
   to it.  Beings without a mind would be impenetrably resistant.
