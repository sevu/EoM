		----- The Era of Myths -----
           Notes for Development

PLANS for future version:
* change staff sound for celestial mages
* change nailer line
* consider sprite for L4 warg
* come up with stats for new fire elementals
* Firewisp can have a defence animation for s


*Animation Checklist:
*How do the changes to the Therians look. Should the shifting be quicker?
*Does it look better if we make the tornado missile frame (zephyr/djinn) longer? -> looks fine now


NOTES for later, about inconsitencies :
*lvl1 fire elemental: WoL plays first the fire sound, then the claws sound
 lvl2&3: WoL plays them the same time, we play first the fire sound (swapped behavior to lvl 1)
*compare Air Elemental's (lvl0) recruit animation with the one in EoC / WoL
*recheck lvl 1&2 earth elemental, noted sth. is probably better about the animation in WoL
*have unified aura wave animation among therians and wargs


IDEAS about Graphics:
*The main problem with the blood manipulator animation seems to be that he's higher in the attack frames, there is an in-between frame needed to the base and defense frame
*there is an alternative icicle icon in WoL
*Maybe we could uses this: https://r.wesnoth.org/p382676
    -> moon blade animation is now included, but disabled
       the switch from moon-blade-attack-8.png to moon-blade.png is looking bad
    -> the warg warrior animation with two attacks, maybe we can split it in two animations
*Make the flyers and attackers fly too, by moving the picture a few pixels up and down
*how about using razorbird-attack image for a moving animation?

Resurgence Ability:
*fire resurgence: an completely different idea would be to give the regenartion when beeing adjacent (and on) Ql*^* tiles
